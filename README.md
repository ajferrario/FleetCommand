# FleetCommand
A simulation-style space combat game

Hi Friends,

My name is Anthony and this is my first project here on GitHub. I work as a product manager for a SaaS start-up and am a huge fan of military science fiction - specifically space fleet engagements. I love the work of David Weber and Jack Campbell and would love to have a way to recreate those epic engagements.

The intention of this project is to build a very flexible game engine that will allow space battles to take place while observing the laws of physics or pseudo-physics as the case may be. The project is currently in its very beginning phases and isn't operable in any way.

If you're interested in helping me out or following my progress feel free :).
